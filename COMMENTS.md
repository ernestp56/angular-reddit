Nice to have:
    Responsiveness:
        - on small screen, the comments get pushed too far to the right.
    Comments depth:
        - when there is too many, they are not displayed - API setup
    Text displayed:
        - since the images src are part of text, they don't get properly rendered
        - links look weird, some characters too
    Loading:
        - add effect on loading of posts so that the user knows there is something happening

Bugs:
    - pinned posts are sent together with first request of a certain subreddit. This caused me quite a bit of confusion and delay as I had no idea about it.
    - when changing the number of posts shown, which post should it display after?
